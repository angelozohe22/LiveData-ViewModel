# LiveData-ViewModel
In this case, we are going to learn how to create a simple app
using LiveData, ViewModel and ViewBinding to bind our components.

What is LiveData?
Basically LiveData is an observable data container.
It allows your application components, usually the user interface, to watch LiveData objects for changes.

LiveData is similar to RxJava except LiveData is lifecycle aware.

Note:
  * We need to add the ViewModel and LiveData implementation and enable ViewBinding in the gradle module at the app level
